This repository holds code/solutions for the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). According to the website: 

> What is Project Euler?
>
> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
>
> The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

I started working on the Project Euler solutions in August 2019 to improve my programming skills. As of January 2021, all of my solutions have been complete using R. One of my goals for this year is to expand solutions into Python. 

I approach these problems like [code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf), trying to find the solution in the shortest amount of time with the shortest source code. I have found that part of the challenge for some of these solutions is using effect programming practices that are not memory-intensive.
