This repository holds my code/solutions for the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). If you're unfamiliar, here is a short description given on the project website: 

> What is Project Euler?
>
> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
>
> The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

I started working on the Project Euler solutions in August 2019 to improve my programming skills in a fun and low-key setting. As of January 2021, all of my solutions have been complete using R. One of my goals for this year is to expand solutions into Python. 

I approach these problems as [code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf), trying to find the solution in the shortest amount of time with the shortest source code. I have found that part of the challenge for some of these solutions is using effective programming practices that are not memory-intensive.
